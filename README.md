# :zap: My Favourite .NET Content Creators

With creators I mean enthusiasts creating content for Blogs, YouTube, Twitch, Books, tutorial platforms (e.g. Pluralsight)

* :writing_hand: Bloggers
* :film_projector: YouTubers
* :open_book: Book authors
* :receipt: Free or paid conntent
* :world_map: The country doesn't matter as well, but I thought it is an excellent way to divide the list into sections and to challenge everyone to find good creators from all countries.
* :speaking_head: All creators listed here also create content in English or only create content in English.
* :compass: What I call the "main channel" is just what seems to be the most updated and well-known channel from where you would find all the other work from your creator best.
